# Project Synopsis

As shoreline development and sea level rise continue to project and expand across the Puget Sound, there has been growing concerns on the ecological risk that coastal squeezing may induce onto intertidal organisms like hairy shore crabs. Forcing them into higher densities, habitat reduction will impose a physiological stress and shift conspecific and interspecific dyanmics across the intertidals. This study investigates the effects of crowding and altered water conditions from crowing on the metabolic activities in _Hemigrapsus Oregonensis_. We hypothesized that both direct crowding and indirect crowding cues would increase the oxygen consumption, which reflects the metabolic stress exhibited by the individuals. The study was conducted in two phases: one measuring the consumption of oxygen under crowding and uncrowding conditions, and the second one assessed the effects of crowd-conditioned water using the same metrics. Oxygen consumption was measured using a resazurin-based fluorescence assay, and righting was also recorded to observe behavioral stress. Results showed that crabs in crowded conditions exhibited the highest metabolic rate and consumption of oxygen over time compared to uncrowded and control groups. In contrast, crabs only exposed to crowd-conditioned water showed minimal changes in metabolism, suggesting that physical crowding played a stronger role than chemical cues alone. The crowded tanks also experienced increased salinity, mortality, and limb loss, indicating compounded stress effects from both density and quality of water. These findings highlight the physiological impacts of coastal squeeze and emphasizes the need for shoreline management strategies, like natural living shorelines, that preserves intertidal habitats and ecosystem.
